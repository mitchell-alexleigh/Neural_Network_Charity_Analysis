# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this project is to you Neural Networks for classification. By doing this we hope to understand how the compay Alphbet soup determins who they donate too inorder to imporve our chances of recieving funding 

## Results
### Data Processing

* The Targer is the "IS_SUCCESSFUL" column
* 'AFFILIATION','USE_CASE','ORGANIZATION','INCOME_AMT','SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS','APPLICATION_TYPE','CLASSIFICATION', 'NAME' and 'EIN' are neither target nor features 
* The remaining columns are Features split into columns with dummy incoding 

### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

* The process for training is trial and error based on the resourses presenting in this moduel 

## Summary 

In conclusion the model nevery reached 75% accuracy. Further research on classification is required.
